# Design

I chose a familiar design to most, Nasa's web sites. I went with this because I love the simplicity of it and tried make it looks familiar for the users. This is a News report app and the visualizations and credibility are what draw the users in and I wouldn't want to take away from that. The next piece I am building a Interactive Dashboard that allow to measure what users are more interested so see.
