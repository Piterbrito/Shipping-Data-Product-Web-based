  #Also in the Navbar, click in Dashboard there is an Interactive Interface that you can play with the data collected.<br/>
  #At least in the Navbar, Click in API there is available all the historic data that has been collected and stored into the Database in JSON format, you can use it in your Project/Research.


# Design

I chose a familiar design to most, Nasa's web sites. I went with this because I love the simplicity of it and tried make it looks familiar for the users. This is a News report app and the visualizations and credibility are what draw the users in and I wouldn't want to take away from that. The next piece I am building a Interactive Dashboard that allow to measure what users are more interested so see.

# Run Locally
#Run this command git clone https://github.com/Piterbrito/Shipping-Data-Product-Web-based/<br/>
#Make sure you have installed in your computer all libraries used above <br/>
#Double check if you are in the right directory in you terminal ...that often cause errors<br/>
#Terminal Should be addressed at folder: flask_app<br/>
#Run the command: python app.py in your terminal<br/>
#Copy the output link and paste in your Browser<br/>
#You are now in the dev environment and you can play around<br/>
